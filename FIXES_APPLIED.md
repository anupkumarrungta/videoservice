# Video Translation Service - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Video Length Issue (Output video was only 1 minute instead of 6:49 minutes)

**Problem**: The output video was being truncated to only 1 minute due to the `-shortest` flag being used in FFmpeg commands.

**Root Cause**: The `-shortest` flag in FFmpeg limits the output duration to the shortest stream (audio or video), which was causing the video to be cut short.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Removed all `-shortest` flags from FFmpeg commands in `VideoProcessingService.java`
- Added `preserve-duration: true` configuration in `application.yml`
- Reduced chunk duration from 180 seconds (3 minutes) to 60 seconds (1 minute) for better processing
- **NEW**: Created `createVideoWithPreservedDuration()` method that explicitly preserves video duration
- **NEW**: Added FFmpeg flags `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero`, `-fflags +genpts`, and `-max_interleave_delta 0` for better duration preservation
- **NEW**: Added duration verification to ensure output video matches input video duration

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/videoservice/service/VideoProcessingService.java` - Removed `-shortest` flags and added new duration preservation method
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` - Added preserve-duration setting and reduced chunk duration

### 2. S3 404 Error Issue (Latest Fix)

**Problem**: "The specified key does not exist" error when AWS Transcribe tries to access S3 files.

**Root Cause**: Timing issue where AWS Transcribe tries to access files before they're fully uploaded to S3.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **NEW**: Added `verifyS3FileExists()` method with retry logic to ensure files exist before transcription
- **NEW**: Added `verifyS3BucketAccess()` method for startup verification
- **NEW**: Enhanced error logging for better debugging of S3 issues
- **NEW**: Added file existence verification before starting transcription jobs
- **NEW**: Created `test-s3-access.ps1` script to test S3 bucket and file operations

### 3. Translation Issue (Output Hindi audio was random, not correctly translated)

**Problem**: The output Hindi audio was not the correct translation of the input English audio. The system was using mock transcription data instead of actual AWS Transcribe.

**Root Cause**: AWS Transcribe was failing and falling back to mock Hindi text, which was then being translated to Hindi (resulting in incorrect content).

**Fixes Applied**:
- **NEW**: Completely removed mock transcription fallback - now throws errors instead of using mock data
- Improved logging to detect when mock transcription is being used
- Added `isMockTranscription()` method to identify mock data
- Enhanced error logging to help debug AWS service issues
- Fixed log messages to show correct source language information
- **NEW**: Added comprehensive AWS debugging script

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/videoservice/service/TranscriptionService.java` - Removed mock fallback and added better error handling
- `src/main/java/com/videoservice/service/JobManager.java` - Added warnings for mock transcription usage

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test AWS Credentials
Run the comprehensive AWS debugging script:
```powershell
.\debug-aws-issues.ps1
```

This will verify that:
- AWS CLI is properly configured
- AWS credentials are valid
- S3 bucket access is working
- AWS Transcribe service is accessible
- AWS Translate service is accessible
- AWS Polly service is accessible
- Network connectivity to AWS services
- Environment variables and configuration files

### 2. Test Video Translation
1. Upload a video with English audio (6+ minutes)
2. Set source language to "english" in the request
3. Set target language to "hindi"
4. Monitor the logs for:
   - No warnings about mock transcription
   - Correct source language being used (en-US)
   - Proper chunk processing

### 3. Verify Output
- Check that the output video duration matches the input video duration
- Verify that the Hindi audio is a proper translation of the English content
- Ensure no mock transcription warnings appear in logs

## Configuration Changes

### Audio Processing
```yaml
audio:
  chunk-duration: 60 # Reduced from 180 to 60 seconds
```

### Video Processing
```yaml
video:
  preserve-duration: true # New setting to preserve video duration
```

## Troubleshooting

### If video is still truncated:
1. Check FFmpeg installation and path
2. Verify video file format is supported
3. Check logs for FFmpeg errors

### If you get S3 404 errors:
1. Run `.\test-s3-access.ps1` to verify S3 bucket and file operations
2. Check that the S3 bucket exists and is accessible
3. Verify AWS credentials have S3 permissions
4. Monitor logs for S3 upload and verification messages
5. Ensure transcription and transcription-results folders exist in S3

### If translation is still incorrect:
1. Run `.\debug-aws-issues.ps1` to verify AWS services
2. Check that source language is set to "english" in the request
3. Monitor logs for AWS Transcribe errors (no more mock warnings)
4. Verify AWS Transcribe permissions in IAM
5. Ensure S3 bucket exists and is accessible

### If AWS services are failing:
1. Check AWS credentials and region
2. Verify IAM permissions for Transcribe, Translate, and Polly
3. Ensure S3 bucket exists and is accessible
4. Check network connectivity to AWS services

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Video Duration**: Output video should have the same duration as input video (with 5% tolerance)
2. **Translation Quality**: Hindi audio should be a proper translation of English content (no more mock data)
3. **Logging**: Clear indication of source language and AWS service errors
4. **Error Handling**: Explicit errors when AWS services fail (no silent fallbacks to mock data)
